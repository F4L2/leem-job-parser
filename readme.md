A Web parser to browse more easily the job post for young graduate on leem.org: https://www.emploi.leem.org/espaces-sp%C3%A9cialis%C3%A9s-offre/jeunes-pro-2-ans-exp    I was consulting the fresh graduate job posting section of leem.org, while I've found some interesting jobposts, it was really annoying to browse.  So I made this little program to mine and filter junior jobposts. The results are periodically printed in a table below via a CRON that I've set to run daily.
